## The vision?

Design and develop a website at the level of a super eye-catching design agency. The website should be performant, smooth, and flow seamlessly. Its purpose is to showcase my projects in the best possible way.

## What actually happen?

Messing around for days with **R3F** and **Typescript** while having zero knowledge about the basics concepts of the 3Dfl[] world **ThreeJS** itself. What&#39;s a scene? a camera? a mesh? gltf model? and so on..

I also happen to not create the basic wireframe for how the page layout should be, basically just design it on the go, bad strategy.

## Stacks used

- Next 13 (App directory)
