- Hi, I'm **Muhammad Fajar Alfath**, an informatics engineering graduate from Brawijaya University, ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡©.
- I do **frontend** work while occasionally learning about backend dev along the way. Familiar with PWA's approach & responsive design, but I'm open to learning mobile dev. I mainly use **React**, **Next.js** and **TS** for my projects.
- Currently, I'm exploring the world of **creative coding**, combining my passion for design and coding.
- I enjoy listening to rock covers/instrumental music, exploring current AI trends, as well as running/calisthenics for fun.
