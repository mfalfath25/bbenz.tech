- Hi, I'm **Fajar Alfath**, an aspiring <u>developer</u> based in <span className='text-2xl'>ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡©</span>. Mainly use **React**/**Next.js** and **TS** as my stack.
- I specialize in **frontend** work and occasionally delve into backend as well. I'm familiar with PWA's approach & responsive design but also open to learn mobile development.
- Lately i've been exploring the world of **creative coding**, merging my abstract design taste with code. Currently experimenting with micro interaction and web animations.
- Apart from the serious stuff, I enjoy tuning to rock covers/instrumental music, browsing the current generative AI trends, and occasionally running/calisthenics for fun.
