- Hi, I'm **Muhammad Fajar Alfath**, an informatics engineering graduate from Brawijaya University, ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡©.
- I'm interested in web development, especially in **frontend** work, while occasionally learning about backend development along the way. Never really develop a mobile app, just familiar with the PWA & responsive design approach, but I'm open to learning it.
- I develop web apps using **Next.js**, **React.js**, and **Tailwind CSS** as my primary stack.
- Currently, I'm exploring the world of **creative coding**, combining my passion for design and programming.
- I enjoy listening to rock covers/instrumental music, exploring current AI trends, as well as doing calisthenics for fun.
